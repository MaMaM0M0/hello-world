# hello-world
The repository I was told to make. Maybe I can update this description?
A bit about myself: I was an English and Philosophy major who found all the word stuff easy. Computers and math took much, much more work...but i was better at them than I thought. Now I'm, taking a webdev course and this stuff - which I can understand it relatively easy - is far from intuitive. But to quote Diamond Dallas Page and other greats: "You will not outwork me."
